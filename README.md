# LocFlix
A UWP/WPF application for organizing and viewing your local movie collection.

To use this application you need a TMDB api key, you can get this from https://www.themoviedb.org.

If you would like to fiddle around with the same dataset as I'm using, then go to https://github.com/alxbrn/LocFlix/releases and download the movies.json data set.

(LocFlix stands for Local NetFlix)

Enjoy!
